## Swift 3 Custom Transitions Demonstration

This is an demonstration of using custom transitions in Swift 3, including interactive transitions and presentation controllers.

See WWDC 2013 video [Custom Transitions Using View Controllers.](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2013/?id=218), which shows an example of precisely this. For a discussion of presentation controllers, see WWDC 2014 videos [View Controller Advancements in iOS 8](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=214) and [A Look Inside Presentation Controllers](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2014/?id=228). This is a Swift 3 implementation.


Developed in Swift 3 on Xcode 8.2.1 for iOS 10. But, the basic ideas are equally applicable for different versions of Swift and/or Objective-C.
